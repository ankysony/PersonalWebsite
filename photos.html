                        This was the first department dinner day. This is the only photo which i have of people out of my group. Never thought that the last year's gala dinner would be eaten up by coronavirus.

                        On this day I gave party to all these people for a birthday which was on 2nd June. After eating we did a lot of gossip on assi-ghat (Our usual spot of hanging out.)

                        This was very horrible day, we reached barbeque-nation at 3pm but the opening time was 7pm and all this happened when we had canceled our lunch.

                        Captured this moment on completion of internship at Xpressbees Pune. It was so much fun to live in a pg with 6 other people in the room. Met so many unique personalities.

                        This was the happiest day of my entire 4 years journey of college. I got finally placed on day 3. One of my friends stopped talking with me a long way before, but on this day he hugged me when I came back to college. I can never forget that moment.

                        Enjoyed this trip, It was a lot of fun especially that running after the bus moment. Brought back so many memories with us of nepal. Never thought this would be the last trip for us.

                        Final semester We had so many puppies in our hostel, we spent a lot of our time in garden with them. Never thought 5th march would be the last day of our college, but I take so many good memories and friends out of this college (IIT BHU Varanasi <i class="fas heart fa-heart"></i> ).
